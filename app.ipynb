      "Lamotrigine was, however, evaluated for its antidepressant efficacy and safety in unipolar depression in a number of GlaxoSmithKline-sponsored, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized trials. Although some of these trials reported that patients on lamotrigine experienced more improvement, the differences between lamotrigine and placebo were not statistically significant on any of the efficacy measures used DeVeaugh-Geiss et al., 2000; Laurenza et al., 1999; Londborg et al., 1999. Tolerability and safety of lamotrigine has been established in at least eight placebo-controlled clinical trials, with an adverse-event profile generally comparable with that of placebo, when it is used as monotherapy or as an adjunctive therapy. Serious rash occurred rarely 0.1 incidence, and headaches was the commonest side effect Goodwin et al., 2004. Lamotrigine can be safely combined with most psychotropic drugs Reimers et al., 2005. METHODS Fourteen patients, both males and females between ages 18 and 65, with DSM-IV-R diagnosis of unipolar depression were included in the study. Diagnosis was confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview MINI; Sheehan and Lecrubier, 2001â€“2005. Only patients who had failed to respond to at least two 8-week trials of antidepressant treatment, defined as failure to respond with 50 reduction in symptoms of depression, as measured by Montgomeryâ€“ Asberg Depression Rating Scale MADRS; Montgomery and Asberg, 1979 score 430 were included. Modified criteria from Thase and Rush 1997 were used to classify treatment-resistant depression TRD Grade 1, absence of response to one antidepressant; Grade 2, absence of response to two or more antidepressants, one of them from a different group; Grade 3, absence of response to combination andor augmentation strategy; Grade 4, Grade 31 absence of response to an irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor; Grade 5, Grade 31absence of response to electroconvulsive therapy ECT; Table 1. All patients were rated as moderately to severely ill prior to the adjunctive treatment and functioning poorly, and three patients had also failed ECT andor transcranial magnetic stimulation trials, as well as the antidepressants trials Table 1. Patients with psychotic disorders, alcohol or drug abuse, and eating disorders were excluded, and all patients remained compliant with the adjuctive treatment of lamotrigine for at least 6 months. Patients provided informed consent, approved by the University of Calgary Conjoint Scientific and Ethics Board. Lamotrigine was added to existing antidepressants, and the dose was titrated, according to clinical response and tolerance, with 25- to 50-mg increments every 2 weeks, to a maximum dose of 200 mgday.We recorded patients demographic data and scores of effectiveness measures completed prospectively in patients charts in follow-up visits for at least 6 months of adjuvant treatment. Efficacy measures included changes of the following scales at baseline before adding lamotrigine, at 8 weeks, and at 6 months the CGI-S National Institute of Mental Health, 1970, as the primary efficacy measure, the MADRS, and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale GAF; Luborsky, 1962. We paired baseline measures, prior to adding lamotrigine, with those at 8 weeks and at 6 months after adding lamotrigine, utilizing a paired t-test. A qualified psychiatrist carried out ratings, and no interrater reliability measures were taken. Monitoring for skin rashes, headache, dizziness, somnolence, and gastrointestinal GI disturbances was carried out to assess tolerance to adjunctive treatments Bowden et al., 2004. Patients were instructed to stop the drug, and to report rashes immediately should they develop. All patients in follow-up visits were asked about headache, dizziness, somnolence, and insomnia, in addition to skin rashes. RESULTS Table 1 displays demographic variables, details of the current illness, and data on past failed biological treatment trials. Twelve patients 85.7 completed the 6-month trial of the adjuvant treatment. Lamotrigine dosage ranged from 50 mgday to 200 mgday.\n"
