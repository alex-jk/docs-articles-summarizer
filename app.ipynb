      "Abstract. Aim Persistent depressive disorder PDD was first introduced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition DSM-5, which encompasses numerous different conditions, including dysthymia, recurrent major depressive disorder, double depression, and chronic major depression. SSRIs are the first-line drugs for treatment of PDD; however, not all patients respond to SSRI treatment. Case presentation We describe a woman who was diagnosed with PDD. At the age of 38, the patient presented with anxiety, reduced energy, marked tiredness, and sleep disturbances. She was prescribed with three antidepressants paroxetine, duloxetine, and mirtazapine, which were not effective in relieving her symptoms. She was also prescribed bromazepam, which was also not effective. Subsequently, she was switched to lamotrigine, which resulted in a marked improvement in symptoms. The antidepressants and bromazepam were gradually tapered and discontinued. Conclusion This case demonstrates that lamotrigine may be effective for treating patients with antidepressant resistant PDD and suggests that it may be a promising alternative to combination therapy of antidepressants and benzodiazepines in the treatment of PDD. INTRODUCTION. Persistent depressive disorder PDD was first introduced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition DSM-5, which encompasses numerous different conditions, including dysthymia DST, recurrent major depressive disorder, double depression, and chronic major depression. Since its inception in the DSM-III, DST has been widely criticized for its significant heterogeneity of the diagnosis, and these criticisms have continued with PDD, its latest classification. Several reports have examined the efficacy and acceptability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of PDD1 and have provided evidence for the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of chronic depression. However, reports have shown that up to two-thirds of adult patients do not achieve remission with SSRI treatment. Moreover, there is limited evidence identifying reliable predictors eg, demographic, clinical, or genetic characteristics of individual response.2,3 Therefore, effective treatment of patients with PDD who do not respond to SSRIs remains elusive. Here, we report a patient who was diagnosed with PDD who showed insufficient improvement with a combination therapy of antidepressants but achieved remission with lamotrigine monotherapy. CASE REPORT. The patient was a woman in her 50s. Her mother, grandmother, and aunt were diagnosed with major depressive disorder and committed suicide. She worked in a hospital as a nurse. At the age of 38 years, she began experiencing fatigue and wobble. She visited a general medicine clinic, but no abnormalities were detected. She presented with symptoms of depression eg, depressed mood, reduced energy, pessimism, and sleep disturbances. She did not present with hypomanic or manic symptoms, such as mood elevation. At the psychiatry clinic, she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and was started on paroxetine. However, her symptoms remained unstable, and she remitted and relapsed repeatedly. Her diagnosis was revised from major depressive disorder to PDD, and duloxetine and mirtazapine were added to her treatment when she was aged 45 and 46 years, respectively. She was prescribed maximum doses of paroxetine, duloxetine, and mirtazapine; however, her symptoms did not improve. Furthermore, she was prescribed the maximum dose of bromazepam for anxiety, but her anxiety symptoms persisted. Although the patient had treatment resistance to antidepressants, she did not experience severe depressive symptoms such as suicidal ideation or psychotic symptoms such as delusions; thus, augmentation therapy with antipsychotics and electroconvulsive therapy were considered unsuitable. Subsequently, she was treated with lamotrigine and her symptoms of depressions stabilized. The three antidepressants were gradually tapered and discontinued. Her anxiety also improved dramatically, and bromazepam was gradually tapered and discontinued.\n"
