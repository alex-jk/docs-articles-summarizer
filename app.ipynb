Other scales included the Montgomery–˚Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS) and the Global Assessment of FunctioningScale (GAF).Monitoring for skin rashes, headache,dizziness, somnolence, andgastrointestinal disturbances was carried out to assess for adverse events.Baseline measures prior to adding lamotrigine were compared to those at 8weeks and 6 months with adjunctive treatment. Twelve patients of the total(n514) completed the trial, and two discontinued treatment.
