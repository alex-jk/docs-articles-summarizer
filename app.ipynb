      "We amended our analysis strategy after registering our review; these changes were to better align with new norms established by the Cochrane Comparing Multiple Interventions Methods Group. These norms were introduced between the publication of our protocol and the preparation of this manuscript. The largest change was using the confidence in network meta-analysis CINeMA online tool instead of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation GRADE guidelines and adopting methods to facilitate assessmentsâfor example, instead of using an omnibus test for all treatments, we assessed publication bias for each treatment compared with active controls. We also modelled acceptability through dropout rate, which was not predefined but was adopted in response to a reviewerâs comment. Eligibility criteria. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be randomised controlled trials that included exercise as a treatment for depression and included participants who met the criteria for major depressive disorder, either clinician diagnosed or identified through participant self-report as exceeding established clinical thresholds eg, scored 13 on the Beck depression inventory-II. Studies could meet these criteria when all the participants had depression or when the study reported depression outcomes for a subgroup of participants with depression at the start of the study. We defined exercise as âœplanned, structured and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness.â Unlike recent reviews, we included studies with more than one exercise arm and multifaceted interventions eg, health and exercise counselling as long as they contained a substantial exercise component. These trials could be included because network meta-analysis methods allows for the grouping of those interventions into homogenous nodes. Unlike the most recent Cochrane review, we also included participants with physical comorbidities such as arthritis and participants with postpartum depression because the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, fifth edition, removed the postpartum onset specifier after that analysis was completed. Studies were excluded if interventions were shorter than one week, depression was not reported as an outcome, and data were insufficient to calculate an effect size for each arm. Any comparison condition was included, allowing us to quantify the effects against established treatments eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs, cognitive behavioural therapy, active control conditions usual care, placebo tablet, stretching, educational control, and social support, or waitlist control conditions. Published and unpublished studies were included, with no restrictions on language applied. Information sources. We adapted the search strategy from the most recent Cochrane review, adding keywords for yoga, tai chi, and qigong, as they met our definition for exercise. We conducted database searches, without filters or date limits, in The Cochrane Library via CENTRAL, SPORTDiscus via Embase, and Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO via Ovid. We assessed full texts of all included studies from two systematic reviews of exercise for depression. Results. Study selection. The PRISMA flow diagram outlines the study selection process fig 1. We used two previous reviews to identify potentially eligible studies for inclusion. Database searches identified 18658 possible studies.
