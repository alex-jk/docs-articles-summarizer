# docs-articles-summarizer

This project uses a T5 model (a transformer-based model) to generate concise summaries of text files. It reads the content of each file, preprocesses it, and applies T5â€™s summarization capabilities to produce a clear, condensed version of the text, saving the output in a readable format.
